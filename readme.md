# Library Data Processing Project

This Python program processes a CSV file containing information about books in a library and generates a summary report with the following statistics:
- Number of books that are available and borrowed
- Oldest and newest book based on publication year
- A list of books that are overdue

## Files Included
- `library_stats.py` – main Python script
- `run_library.bat` – batch file to execute the program easily
- `books.csv` – sample data file
- `library_summary.txt` – generated output file after running the program

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
2. Place `library_stats.py`, `books.csv`, and `run_library.bat` in the same folder.
3. Double-click `run_library.bat` to execute the script and generate the summary.
4. The summary will be saved as `library_summary.txt` and will open automatically in Notepad.
